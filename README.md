# ROCAUC_Orange-Grapefruit
I completed this project for a Hackathon. It consisted of a new binary classifier learning system that can appropriately manage risk by accounting for the entire ROC curve rather than an arbitrary cutoff value. I most enjoyed writing the Population.py file because evolutionary based learning feels like the most natural system for modeling improvement, and it well encapsulated the entire underlying model so it could be used in other systems. This code does have some improvements that I am planning to address in the future, most importantly a more robust learning method based on the ROC curve to move away offspring having weights and incorporate more mathematical ML principles (ex back-propogation).
